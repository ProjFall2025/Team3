### By Michael Brukson, Anthony Nosoff, and Michael Tesis

## Our Mission
Have you ever listened to a song and thought to yourself, *man! I'd love to play that myself!*<br>
Well, we have, and we want to make it easier for everyone to generate the sheet music behind your favorite audio.

## Our Target Audience


## Main Features
1. Model for recognizing and splitting instruments in a audio
2. Model for determining rhythm in audio
3. Model for determining frequency in audio
4. UI for uploading audio
5. Backend for processing audio
6. Output with appropriate sheet music
7. User element: seeing past uploads
8. User element: exploring and following other users

## Preliminary Development Plan
### Research & Analysis 
- How you’ll refine user needs and study competitors.

### Design – UI/UX considerations 
- (layout, navigation, accessibility, etc.).

### Development 
- Front-end and back-end technologies you would use.

### Testing
- How you’ll test usability, performance, and security.

### Launch & Maintenance 
- Strategy for release and ongoing updates.


## Functional requirements
- Database that stores the following:
- ...
- Backend (using Node.js)

## Non-functional requirements
- External API
- Internal API

## Non-functional choices
- React Frontend
- Postgresql

## Project Description
Knowtes is a music recognition software. Users can upload an mp3 file or a wav file and the software will give the user the transcribed sheet music for that song. Alternatively, users may also request a song's transcription via its name directly; upon which the software will make an external API call for that song.

### Key Notes

# Project Part 1: Website Conceptualization & Planning

### Objective

You will document the concept for the website theme chosen in class. Each team member will contribute to the project by updating the README.md file in your team’s GitHub repository. This assignment emphasizes both project planning and collaborative version control.

## Instructions

### 1. Website Conceptualization

Revisit the theme selected in class.
Write a mission statement that explains the core goal of your website.
### 2. Target Users

Identify at least three user groups your site will serve.
For each group, describe:
Demographics and interests.
What they need from your site.
How your site supports them.
### 3. Main Functionalities

Describe at least eight (8) features of your website.Briefly describe the functionality to be an EPIC (will cover the issues types next week)
Explain how these features align with your mission and user needs.
Highlight any unique selling points (USPs).
### 4. Preliminary Development Plan

Outline a five-phase plan:

Research & Analysis – How you’ll refine user needs and study competitors.
Design – UI/UX considerations (layout, navigation, accessibility, etc.).
Development – Front-end and back-end technologies you would use.
Testing – How you’ll test usability, performance, and security.
Launch & Maintenance – Strategy for release and ongoing updates.
Deliverable (via GitHub)

Use your team’s existing GitHub repository:
Update the README.md file with:
Project Name
Students Name (Student 1,Student 2,...)
All required sections (Conceptualization, Target Users, Functionalities, Development Plan).
Length: 1200–1500 words total.
All three team members’ names at the top.
Collaboration Requirement

Each student must contribute to the README.md at least once.
Commit messages must be clear and descriptive.
Contributions may include writing, editing, formatting, or adding references.
Git Workflow Options

Command line basics:

    git clone <repo_url>
    git checkout -b <branchname>
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Added mission statement section"
    git push origin <branchname>

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub and merge changes.

Or use a Git client (e.g., GitHub Desktop, Sourcetree, VS Code built-in Git).
## Assessment Criteria

Content Quality – Mission, users, features, and plan are thorough and realistic.
Collaboration – All members contributed (verified via Git commit history).
Commit Messages – Clear, professional, and descriptive.
Organization – README is well-formatted in Markdown, easy to read.
## Submission Guidelines

Upload here your GitHub readme page (grading will be on BrightSpace) .
Ensure all members names are included at the top of the README.
Each team member must have at least one commit with a meaningful message.
